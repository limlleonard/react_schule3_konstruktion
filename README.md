This project comes from an old project, while I still worked as a teacher in the school. In a pratice, the students should construct conic section (ellipse, hyperbola and parabola) with ruler and compass. The project shows the step by step instruction. At that time, I wrote the project in Pygame. Since I learned React, it is nice to update the project and make it easier to be accessed.
